My solutions to Project Euler problems.

Primarily implemented using Python and Mathematica although I may dabble a bit with other languages at times.

Standard folder structure for a problem:
  - prob###/                    Problem folder containing required files, notes, and code.
  - prob###/problem###.txt      Copy of the problem from the Project Euler website
  - prob###/prob###.*           Final solution for the problem - if revised/optimized at a later date a letter will be added after the problem number
  - prob###/prob###work.nb      Scratch notebook for developing a Mathematica solution. May contain notes, new functions, and rough draft attempts.
  - prob###/prob###func.py		Functions created to solve the problem pulled out to be available for later use.
  - prob###/prob###out			

Other Files
  - ProjectEuler.nb             Compilation of Mathematica solutions to date - new problems aren't added until they have been submitted and accepted on the website.
